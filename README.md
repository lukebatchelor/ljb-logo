# LJB Logo
#### An open source Logo to JS compiler
---

This is an attempt at writing a compiler that can take LOGO code and turn it into valid JS code that outputs to a canvas element.

Future support is planned for:
* Saving Images
* Saving gifs
* CLI support
* Language support (syntax highlighting, type checking, autocompletion)
